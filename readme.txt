This engine is the version that provides the functionality of the fighting game Mahvel Baybe!, it is not the final version, nor
the most optimized version of the engine.  I appologize for any inconvience or performance issues this version may cause in advance.

Controls:
Dr. Doom
WASD - Movement
r - jab
t - medium
y - heavy
g - launcher
f - block

Strider Hiryu
Arrows - Movement
j - light
k - medium
l - heavy
m - launcher
n - block

These controls are not final

Launching will unleash a one hit kill move as aerial combos have not yet been implemented

Update 10/21: The game's floor has shifted down to make the players look more like they are walking on the ground.
The game does not currently run on an entity system as that is currently in the works, but for now the game functions
just fine.

Update 10/25: Press O and P to change stages

Update 10/26: Added background music, audio.c, and audio.h.
