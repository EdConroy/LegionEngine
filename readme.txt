This engine is the version that provides the functionality of the fighting game Mahvel Baybe!, it is not the final version, nor
the most optimized version of the engine.  I am currently working on a more optimized version under the GitHub repository 
LegionEnginePartDuex.  I appologize for any inconvience or performance issues this version may cause in advance.

Controls:
Dr. Doom
WASD - Movement
r - jab
t - medium
y - heavy
g - launcher
f - block

Strider Hiryu
Arrows - Movement
j - light
k - medium
l - heavy
m - launcher
n - block

These controls are not final

Launching will unleash a one hit kill move as aerial combos have not yet been implemented
